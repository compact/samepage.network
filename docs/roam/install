description: Install SamePage into your Roam Graph

Welcome to the SamePage Network! 

## Overview
The SamePage Network (formerly known as RoamJS Multiplayer) extension allows you to connect your Roam Graph to other notebooks using the SamePage Network.

Throughout these docs, you'll see the term 'notebook'. A 'notebook' is a 'workspace' within an 'app'. 
'Apps' include various tools for thought, like Roam, LogSeq, and Obsidian. 
A 'workspace' is an a single instantiation of those 'apps', like a graph or a vault, signified by the __name__. 

So the internal [Roam Help Graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fCaJekIoX) is an example of a 'notebook'. Your personal Roam graph or Obsidian vault named "Metacognition Research" are other examples.

Below are instructions to install SamePage into your Roam graph. 

## Installation
Installation is available through Roam Depot. Search for SamePage and install. 

You will then see SamePage appear under 'Extension Settings'! Click to read more and adjust auto-connection settings.
