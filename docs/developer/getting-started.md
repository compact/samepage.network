The SamePage protocol was designed to be open and extensible. 

All repositories managed by the team are open source and could be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/samepage-network). There are several `npm` packages available under the `@samepage` scope, as well as a monopackage `samepage` that contains all the packages within this scope. These packages are meant to aid in development within the ecosystem, but are not strictly necessary to interface with the protocol.
