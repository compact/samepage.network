The SamePage Obsidian extension allows you to connect your Obsidian Vault to other notebooks using the SamePage Network.

A **Notebook** in Obsidian is a vault. Your personal vault is an example of a **Notebook**.

## Installing the Development version

Click [this link](https://samepage.network/extensions/obsidian.zip) to download the latest development version of the SamePage extension for Obsidian.

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. You then have to move that folder within the folder that represents your vault, within the `.obsidian/plugins` directory:
