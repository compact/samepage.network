The SamePage Roam extension allows you to connect your Obsidian Vault to other notebooks using the SamePage Network. 

A **Notebook** in Obsidian is a vault. Your personal vault is an example of a **Notebook**.

## Installing the Live Version

The stable version of the SamePage extension is still under review for the Obsidian Community Marketplace. Subscribe to our newsletter to be notified when the extension is live!

## Installing the Development version

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. You then have to move that folder within the folder that represents your vault, within the `.obsidian/plugins` directory:

![](/images/obsidian-2.png)

In Obsidian, click on the settings icon on the bottom left and head to the `Community Plugins` tab:

![](/images/obsidian-3.png)

Once you do, you should see SamePage appear in your community plugins section. Click on the toggle next to SamePage to enable the extension:

![](/images/obsidian-4.png)

The extension should automatically load and connect to SamePage!

Because Roam is used in the browser, everytime you load Roam you will need to reload the extension so that it could read it from your file system. This will not be an issue during the **Live** version.
