description: Install SamePage into your Logseq Graph
---

Welcome to the SamePage Network! 

## Overview
The SamePage Network extension allows you to connect your Logseq Graph to other notebooks, like Roam or Obsidian, using the SamePage Network.

Throughout these docs, you'll see the term 'notebook'. A 'notebook' is a 'workspace' within an 'app'. 
'Apps' include various tools for thought, like Roam, LogSeq, and Obsidian. 
A 'workspace' is an a single instantiation of those 'apps', like a graph or a vault, signified by the __name__. 

So the internal [Logseq Docs](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Contents) is an example of a 'notebook'. Your personal Roam graph or Obsidian vault named "Metacognition Research" are other examples.

Below are instructions to install SamePage into your Roam graph. 

## Installation
Installation is available through the Plugins tab in the Options tab in the top right corner. Click 'Marketplace' and search for SamePage. Then click 'Install' and you're set. 

You will then see SamePage appear under 'Installed'. Click to read more and adjust auto-connection settings.
