The SamePage LogSeq extension allows you to connect your LogSeq Graph to other notebooks using the SamePage Network.

A **Notebook** in LogSeq is a graph. The internal [Logseq Docs](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Contents) and your personal graph are examples of **Notebooks**.

## Installing the Live Version

## Installing the Development version

After downloading the extension from SamePage, extract the zip into a folder. That folder could be stored anywhere on your computer.

In Roam, head to your LogSeq settings, head to the `Advanced` tab toggle on `Development Mode` to enable:
